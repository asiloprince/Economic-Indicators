promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

# Description

Economic indicators are statistical measures used to assess the performance and health of an economy. They provide insights into different aspects of economic activity and can help in understanding trends, patterns, and overall economic conditions. The indicators you mentioned are commonly used in economic analysis to evaluate the labor market (unemployment rate), economic growth (GDP growth rate), income levels (GDP per capita), and price stability (inflation).

This submission focuses on the analysis of unemployment rates and other dependent variable in the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 8. SDG 8 aims to promote sustainable economic growth, productive employment, and decent work for all.

The analysis utilizes data on the indicator "Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)" for the years 1996 to 2021. It includes information on each country's GDP growth, GDP per capita growth, total population, and unemployment rate.

Through data visualizations such as charts and graphs, the submission presents a comprehensive overview of the unemployment rates in these countries over the specified period. The visualizations allow for easy comparisons between countries and highlight any notable trends or patterns in unemployment rates.

The analysis contributes to understanding the progress made towards achieving SDG 8 in the selected countries. It provides insights into the employment situation and labor market dynamics, which are crucial for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable economic growth and decent work opportunities.

For a number of factors, the unemployment rate varies significantly between nations throughout the world. These explanations may be divided into two groups based on the two forms of unemployment: cyclical and natural. The current state of the economy is linked to cyclical unemployment. When the economy is in a slump, the unemployment rate rises as firms lay off workers. Conversely, when the economy grows and firms begin to hire, the unemployment rate falls. It normally takes six months to a year of economic expansion for the jobless rate to begin to fall. Similarly, after a few months of output reduction, the unemployment rate begins to rise. So, in any given year, the unemployment rate in a specific nation may be high (or low) depending on whether the country is in a recession (or an expansion). The natural unemployment rate, which is unrelated to the business cycle, consists of two forms of unemployment: frictional and structural. People experiencing frictional unemployment are those who are between jobs because they are relocating from one location to another, entering the labor market after completing their schooling, or for other personal reasons. The structural unemployment is linked to economic structural transformations. As certain industries decrease, such as textile production in the United States, while others increase, such as health care, those who worked in the textile industry lose their employment and must enter the health care sector. This necessitates new knowledge and a new set of abilities, both of which take time to learn. They refer to these folks as fundamentally jobless while they are moving from one industry to another.(Unemployment Rate in ASEAN | TheGlobalEconomy.com, n.d.)

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Identifying the "Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate) and other of each countries on Asean country.

# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY

Unemployment can occur as a result of labor market imbalances. This demonstrates the unemployment rates of different countries in ASEAN each year. The study's goal is to examine the factors that influence unemployment rates in ten ASEAN countries. By graphing unemployment rates, researchers and policymakers can collaborate on developing strategies to reduce unemployment, promote inclusive growth, and improve overall economic well-being.

# Methods

We now know more about the topic because of studies on the unemployment rate in ASEAN nations that have been linked to experimental pieces of data. Accordingly,
It is an appropriate strategy for doing and exploring new research because it involves empirical study. This concentrates on conducting an analysis of information in the ASEAN countries in order to draw a conclusion and provide better guidance. It will also assist us in identifying trends and displaying the normal unemployment trend.
